      <h2>About Parkinson's Disease
      </h2>
      <p>
        Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects
        movement. It occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine
        become damaged or die. Early signs of Parkinson's can include tremors,
        stiffness, and changes in movement patterns. Research has shown that
        changes in typing patterns may be an early indicator of Parkinson's
        disease. By studying these patterns, we can potentially identify
        individuals at risk and provide them with early interventions.

      <p>
        Our dataset was collected by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        (MIT) on two movement disorder units from Madrid, Spain. Subjects were
        given standardized equipment and were told to type as they usually would
        at home, free to correct mistakes if they chose to. The first group
        conducted the study twice with 13 healthy controls and 18 PD sufferers,
        while the second group conducted the study once with 30 healthy controls
        and 24 PD sufferers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the keylogging data (measuring the key pressed, hold time,
        release time, and press time), the subjects also took finger tapping
        tests, which measure the speed and rhythm of finger movements, providing
        additional insights into the progression of Parkinson's disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subjects also completed a questionnaire to assess their Parkinson's
        disease severity using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
        (UPDRS), which assesses motor and non-motor symptoms on a scale from
        0â€“4, with a total score range of 108.

    <h2>PROTOTYPE ONE CHECKPOINT</h2>
    <p>
      1. So far in the project, we have focused on creating an overarching
      theme to the dataset we chose along with an overview of what we are
      looking to explore regarding Parkinson's and typing patterns. In terms
      of visualizations, we have created a density histogram of the typing
      speeds of patients with and without Parkinson's. On the graph, we have
      also created an interactive tooltip that allows users to see different
      areas and values of the graph. We have also established a general
      introduction to the project, such as which columns of the dataset are
      crucial to our analysis. In terms of style, we have streamlined our
      content with margins and proper centering. <br /><br />

      2. The hardest part of the project for us, we believe, will be the
      creation of the typing test in which we use the datasets we have to
      compare a user's typing speeds and patterns. It will require us to find
      a way to initiate a typing test, along with the creation of an interface
      to show how a person is typing in real-time. Furthermore, a bit of
      computation will have to go into creating a general summary of their
      stats for comparison to stats we already have from PD patients. At this
      point so far, one of the challenges we have already encountered was how
      to bring all the datasets together: we not only had to combine both
      cohorts of patients (two datasets of patients), but we also had to link
      each patient to their typing tests (each typing test was its own file).
