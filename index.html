        <h2>About Parkinson's Disease</h2>
        <p>
          Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder impacted by the nervous
          system. It causes neurons in the brain to become damaged and weakened
          which impacts lifestyle such as movement issues, tremors, stiffness,
          and impaired balances. Severe PD patients might have troubles with
          walking, talking, and completing other daily tasks. The damage in the
          neurons causes the affected individuals to have a decrease in
          dopamine. The decrease in dopamine is why the main treatment for PD,
          Levodopa (L-DOPA), attempts to replace dopamine although a major side
          effect is that it can cause paralysis or involuntary movement. Both
          symptoms of PD and the side effects of the treatment impacts movement,
          leading back to our project goal to see the interaction it has with
          typing.

              >Research has implied that varying typing patterns can be an
              indicator of PD. By utilizing and analysing these patterns, we can
              hopefully identify those at risk and provide earlier
              interventions.</b

        </button>

        <p>
          The original dataset was collected by the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT) on 85 subjects from Madrid, Spain. The dataset
          contains keystroke logs from subjects both with and without PD. Typing
          data was collected on standardized equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the keylogged data (measuring the key pressed, hold time,
          etc.), finger tapping tests were also taken that measured the speed
          and rhythm of finger movements, providing additional insights of the
          likelihood of PD.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main takeaway points of the dataset is also the Unified
          Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The score is based
          upon a questionnaire that subjects complete, that assesses subjects on
          motor and non-motor symptoms on a scale from 0-4. It provides a final
          score range from 0-108 with 0 being minimal chances of PD and 108
          being higher risk.

              Although it is expected that there’d be a vast difference in WPM
              since PD impacts movement, but in reality looking at our data,
              there is not that drastic of a difference in typing speed,
              considering how similar the distributions appear.
            </li>

            <li>
              One of the only noticeable differences is the extremities

              without PD.
            </li>

            <li>
              The maximum WPM in the dataset is approximately 257.2 which is very unexpected as even professional
              court reporters often only achieve around 225 WPM with specialized equipment and phonetic shorthands.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Although the model shows a general relationship between typing speed and UPDRS score, there is no definitive threshold that is able to classify an individual’s health status solely based upon
      typing speed. Any predictions
       made should be considered speculative and used only for exploratory purposes, NOT for clinical evaluation.

          In conclusion, our project aims to explore the relationship between
          typing patterns and Parkinson's disease risk. By analyzing typing
          trends, we hope to identify individuals at higher risk of developing
          PD, enabling earlier interventions and better management of the
          disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that this approach can provide valuable insights into the
          early detection of Parkinson's disease and contribute to improving the
          quality of life for those affected by it.
