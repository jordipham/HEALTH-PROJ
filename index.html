          <h2>About Parkinson's Disease</h2>
          <p>
            Parkinson’s Disease is a movement disorder impacted by the nervous
            system. It causes neurons in the brain to become damaged and
            weakened which impacts lifestyle such as movement issues, tremors,
            stiffness, and impaired balance. Severe PD patients might have
            troubles with walking, talking, and completing other daily tasks.
            The damage in the neurons causes the affected individuals to have a
            decrease in dopamine.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the modern world has become more digitized, typing and computer
            usage has become a large part of our lives. People who suffer from
            PD may have difficulty typing or operasting computes due to reduced
            motor function. In fact, research has implied that certain typing
            patterns can serve as an indicator of Parkinson's disease risk.

          <h2>About Our Dataset</h2>

          <p>
            Our original dataset was collected by the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology (MIT) on 85 subjects (43 with Parkinsons, 42 without)
            from Madrid, Spain. It contains keystroke logs from subjects both
            with and without PD. Typing data was collected using standardized
            equipment across all participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides the keylogged data (the key pressed, hold time, release
            time, etc.), finger tapping tests were also taken that measured the
            speed and rhythm of finger movements, providing additional insights
            of the likelihood of PD.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the main takeaway points of the dataset is the Unified
            Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. UPDRS is based
            upon a questionnaire that subjects complete, that assesses subjects
            on motor and non-motor symptoms, each on a scale from 0-4.
            This dataset focused specifically on Part 3 of the UPDRS,  <strong><mark>measuring motor function.</mark></strong>

                For both populations, there is a <mark> negative</mark> trend in
                the regression line, meaning that as the UPDRS score increases,
                the typing speed (WPM) decreases.
              </li>

              <li>
                The slope of regression line for the combined population is a
                decrease of <mark>1.24 WPM </mark>for each point decrease in
                UPDRS score. For subjects with PD there is a decrease of

                Subjects without PD have a much wider range compared to those

              <li>
                Although it would be expected that there would be a vast
                difference in WPM since PD impacts one's movement, our data
                shows that there is <mark>not</mark> a drastic difference in
                typing speed, as the distributions between subjects with PD and
                those without appear quite similar.
              </li>

              <li>
                One noticeable difference, however, is the extremities in the
                data which belong to subjects without Parkinson’s Disease. The
                highest WPM in the dataset is 257.2, which is considered

                  Due to the similar distributions, it is likely that typing

                  cannot distinguish between those with and without PD, as a

                  typing speed.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            Our project aimed to explore the relationship between typing
            patterns and Parkinson's disease risk. We hoped to identify
            individuals at higher risk of developing PD through the analysis of
            their typing speed, enabling earlier intervention and better
            management of the disease.
          </p>

          <p>
            While our analysis of the dataset may have looked promising at the
            start with the clear divide between the typing speeds of both
            population, it became clear that typing speed alone is not a
            sufficient metric for diagnosing Parkinson's disease.
          </p>

          <p>
            The distributions of typing speed between those with and without PD
            were quite similar, as there was not a definitive threshold that
            would allow us to classify an individual’s health status solely
            based on typing speed.
