    <p>Welcome to the Silent Signs project! This project aims to explore the relationship between typing patterns and the risk of Parkinson's disease. By analyzing how people type, we hope to identify early signs that could indicate a higher risk of developing Parkinson's.</p>

        <h2>About Parkinson's Disease</h2>
        <p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine become damaged or die. Early signs of Parkinson's can include tremors, stiffness, and changes in movement patterns. 
        Research has shown that changes in typing patterns may be an early indicator of Parkinson's disease. By studying these patterns, we can potentially identify individuals at risk and provide them with early interventions. The degree of Parkinson's Disease is measured using 
        the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which assesses motor and non-motor symptoms on a scale from 0-4 and has a total score range of 108. The average decrease in typing ability per level is as follows:</p>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Level 1: Minimal symptoms, typing speed may decrease by 5-10%</li>
            <li>Level 2: Mild symptoms, typing speed may decrease by 10-20%</li>
            <li>Level 3: Moderate symptoms, typing speed may decrease by 20-30%</li>
            <li>Level 4: Severe symptoms, typing speed may decrease by 30-50%</li>
            <li>Level 5: Very severe symptoms, typing speed may decrease by more than 50%</li>

        <h2>Typing Test Comparison</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the "Start Typing" button below to begin the typing test.</li>
            <li>Type the provided text as accurately and quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Once you finish, your typing data will be collected for analysis.</li>
            <li>After completing the test, you will receive feedback on your typing performance.</li>
