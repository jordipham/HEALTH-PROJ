    <h1 id="big-title">Silent Signs: Typing Patterns and Parkinson's Risk</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome to the Silent Signs project! This project aims to explore the relationship between typing patterns and the risk of Parkinson's disease. 
    By analyzing how people type, we hope to identify early signs that could indicate a higher risk of developing PD.

        <h2>About Parkinson's Disease</h2>
        <p>
        Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine become damaged or die. 
            
        Early signs of Parkinson's can include tremors, stiffness, and changes in movement patterns. Research has shown that changes in typing patterns may be an early indicator of Parkinson's disease.
        By studying these patterns, we can potentially identify individuals at risk and provide them with early interventions.

        <h2>About Our Dataset</h2>
        <p>
        Our data set was conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on two movement disorder units from Madrid, Spain. Subjects were given standardadized equipment and wwere told to type as they usually would at home, free
        to correct mistakes if they chose to. The first group conducted the study twice with 13 healthy controls and 18 PD sufferers, while the second group conducted the study once with 30 healthy controls and 24 PD sufferers. 

        Besides the keylogging data (measuring the key pressed, hold time, release time, and press time), the subjects also took finger tapping tests, which measure the speed and rhythm of finger movements, measuring motor function which can provide additional insights into the progression of Parkinson's disease.

        Subjects also completed a questionnaire to assess their Parkinson's disease severity using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which assesses motor and non-motor symptoms on a scale from 0-4 and has a total score range of 108.
