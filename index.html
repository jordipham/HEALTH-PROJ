      This project aims to explore the relationship between individual’s typing trends and their risk of 
      Parkinson’s disease (PD). By analyzing the way people type, we hope to identify those with higher risks 
      of developing PD more easily.

      <h2>About Parkinson's Disease
      </h2>
      <p>
        Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder impacted by the nervous system. It causes neurons in the brain
        to become damaged and weakened which impacts lifestyle such as movement issues, tremors, stiffness, and 
        impaired balances. Severe PD patients might have troubles with walking, talking, and completing other daily 
        tasks. The damage in the neurons causes the affected individuals to have a decrease in dopamine. The decrease 
        in dopamine is why the main treatment for PD, Levodopa (L-DOPA), attempts to replace dopamine although a major
        side effect is that it can cause paralysis or involuntary movement. Both symptoms of PD and the side effects 
        of the treatment impacts movement, leading back to our project goal to see the interaction it has with typing.  
        Research has implied that varying typing patterns can be an indicator of PD. By utilizing and analysing these
        patterns, we can hopefully identify those at risk and provide earlier interventions.

      <h2>About Our Dataset

        View Original Dataset
      </button>

      <p>
        The original dataset was collected by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
        on 85 subjects from Madrid, Spain. The dataset contains keystroke logs from subjects both
        with and without PD. Typing data was collected on standardized equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Besides the keylogged data (measuring the key pressed, hold time, etc.), finger tapping tests
         were also taken that measured the speed and rhythm of finger movements, providing additional 
         insights of the likelihood of PD.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the main takeaway points of the dataset is also the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
        score. The score is based upon a questionnaire that subjects complete, that assesses subjects on motor and
        non-motor symptoms on a scale from 0-4. It provides a final score range from 0-108 with 0 being minimal 
        chances of PD and 108 being higher risk.

    <h2>PROTOTYPE ONE CHECKPOINT</h2>
    <p>
      1. So far in the project, we have focused on creating an overarching
      theme to the dataset we chose along with an overview of what we are
      looking to explore regarding Parkinson's and typing patterns. In terms
      of visualizations, we have created a density histogram of the typing
      speeds of patients with and without Parkinson's. On the graph, we have
      also created an interactive tooltip that allows users to see different
      areas and values of the graph. We have also established a general
      introduction to the project, such as which columns of the dataset are
      crucial to our analysis. In terms of style, we have streamlined our
      content with margins and proper centering. <br /><br />

      2. The hardest part of the project for us, we believe, will be the
      creation of the typing test in which we use the datasets we have to
      compare a user's typing speeds and patterns. It will require us to find
      a way to initiate a typing test, along with the creation of an interface
      to show how a person is typing in real-time. Furthermore, a bit of
      computation will have to go into creating a general summary of their
      stats for comparison to stats we already have from PD patients. At this
      point so far, one of the challenges we have already encountered was how
      to bring all the datasets together: we not only had to combine both
      cohorts of patients (two datasets of patients), but we also had to link
      each patient to their typing tests (each typing test was its own file).
