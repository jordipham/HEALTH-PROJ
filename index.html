          This project aims to explore the relationship between individual’s
          typing trends and their risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD). By analyzing
          the way people type, we hope to identify those with higher risks of
          developing PD more easily.

        <h2>About Parkinson's Disease</h2>
        <p>
          Parkinson’s Disease is a movement disorder impacted by the nervous
          system. It causes neurons in the brain to become damaged and weakened
          which impacts lifestyle such as movement issues, tremors, stiffness,
          and impaired balance. Severe PD patients might have troubles with
          walking, talking, and completing other daily tasks. The damage in the
          neurons causes the affected individuals to have a decrease in
          dopamine.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the modern world has become more digitized, typing and computer usage has become a large part of our lives.
          People who suffer from PD may have difficulty typing or operasting computes due to reduced motor function.
          In fact, research has implied that certain typing patterns can serve as an indicator of Parkinson's disease
          risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          <mark><b> Through the analysis of these patterns, we
              hope to identify those who may be at risk and provide earlier
              intervention.</b></mark>

        <h2>About Our Dataset</h2>

        <p>
          Our original dataset was collected by the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT) on 85 subjects (43 with Parkinsons, 42 without) from Madrid, Spain. It
          contains keystroke logs from subjects both with and without PD. Typing
          data was collected using standardized equipment across all participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the keylogged data (the key pressed, hold time, release time,
          etc.), finger tapping tests were also taken that measured the speed
          and rhythm of finger movements, providing additional insights of the
          likelihood of PD.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main takeaway points of the dataset is the Unified
          Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The score is based
          upon a questionnaire that subjects complete, that assesses subjects on
          motor and non-motor symptoms, each on a scale from 0-4.
        </p>
        This dataset focused specifically on Part 3 of the UPDRS, which relates to motor function.

              For both populations, there is a <mark> negative</mark> trend in the

              Subjects without PD have a much wider range compared to those with PD sugguesting that the typing speed of

            <li>
              Although it would be expected that there would be a vast difference in WPM
              since PD impacts one's movement, our data shows that
              there is <mark>not</mark> a drastic difference in typing speed,
              as the distributions between subjects with PD and those without appear quite similar.
            </li>

            <li>
              One noticeable difference, however, is the extremities
              in the data which belong to subjects without Parkinson’s Disease. The highest WPM in the dataset is 257.2, which is considered exceptionally fast.
              </li>

            <li> <mark> 
                  Due to the similar distributions, it is likely that typing speed alone is not a sufficient metric for
                  diagnosis. We cannot distinguish between those with and without PD, as a subject could belong to
                  either population regardless of their typing speed.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Our project aimed to explore the relationship between typing patterns and Parkinson's disease risk. We hoped to
        identify individuals at higher risk of developing
        PD through the analysis of their typing speed, enabling earlier intervention and better management of the
        disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        While our analysis of the dataset may have looked promising at the start with the clear divide between the
        typing speeds of both population, it became clear that typing speed alone is not a sufficient metric for
        diagnosing Parkinson's disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distributions of typing speed between those with and without PD were quite similar, as there was not a
        definitive threshold that would allow us to classify an individual’s health status solely based on typing speed.
      </p>

      <p> <strong> <mark>
            Any predictions made should be considered speculative and used only for exploratory purposes, NOT for
            clinical evaluation.
